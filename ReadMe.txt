To produce Figure 1, the MATLAB file Figure_1.m needs to run. To produce Figure 3A-E, the MATLAB file run_Figure3_rhs.m needs to run while the MATLAB file Figure3_rhs.m is saved in the same folder as the file run_Figure3_rhs.m. Similarly, to produce Figure 5A-D, the MATLAB file run_Figure5_rhs.m needs to run while the MATLAB file Figure5_rhs.m is saved in the same folder as the file run_Figure5_rhs.m
